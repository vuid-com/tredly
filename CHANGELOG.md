## [1.0.0-rc.1]
#### Added
- "tredly config host DNS" command implemented
- Implemented sigint (ctrl-c) capture during creation and will destroy half created container
- Added persistent storage for partitions
- Added persistent storage to list command
- Commenced work on automated tests (/tests)
- Added search for "tredly.json" - the v1.0 JSON based tredlyfile

#### Changed
- Moved all bash libs and python libs to tredly-libs component
- Updated pathing for non installed scripts
- Changed Tredly config container subnet header message
- Standardised pathing for python Tredly modules
- Cleaned up repo directory structure
- Tredly-host moved to python. Tredly-host bash functionality moved to tredly command
- Changed "tredly config api all" to "tredly config api init"
- Functions which should return a value now return a value
- Tredlyfile URLs can now have the relevant protocol in the URL (http:// or https://) which is stripped before processing

#### Fixed
- Tredly-build validation now returns an error message instead of exception
- Container replace - old container will be renamed back to its original name only if it exists
- Changed ip4 tredlyfile validation and replaced with regex
- Updated Tredlyfile schema relating to 'exec_prestart', 'exec_poststart', 'exec_stop' and 'exec_prestop' technical options
- Casting children.max, 'securelevel' and 'devfs_ruleset' to integers in the 0.10 Tredlyfile parser
- Updated Tredlyfile schema - Technical options 'securelevel' now has an allowable range of -1 to 3 and 'devfs_ruleset' now allows any integer value.
- Removed use of ipv4 format validation and replaced with custom pattern as the Python json schema lib does not support the 'format' property.

## [1.0.0-beta - 2016-06-10]
#### Added
- Now importing actions as modules. Allows for "drop in" commands in the same style as the bash tredly-build code
- Added "tredly command container" wrapper for jexec
- Added static ip network setup

#### Changed

- Change exit code for sigint

#### Fixed

## [1.0.0-beta - 2016-06-09]
### HOST
#### Added
- `fail2ban` implemented on host port 65222 tcp (SSH)
- Added Tredly command center to host installer
- Added flag to installer config file to allow set up of SSHd, tredly-api and tredly-cc
- Automatically whitelist Tredly command center
- Added static ips config file
- Added Tredly command centre URL in installer

#### Changed
- Moved location of `tredly-api` and `tredly-cc` within installer
- Installer now fetches kernel source from HTTPS instead of HTTP

### BUILD
#### Added
- `url1ErrorResponse` setting added to layer7Proxy. Defaults to yes. When set to 'yes', the layer7proxy will send the error page. When set to 'no' the container's error page is used instead.
- It is now possible to build container from a remote path using `--path=` to create or replace. _Note that `--path=` will change to `--location=` in the next release_

#### Changed
- Refactored `tredly-build container replace` to use objects instead of using the create/destroy methods.
- layer7Proxy url values are now overwritten with the new container's values upon replace
- nginx cleanup code upon stop now makes use of JSON objects from ZFS
- Automatic redirect from http -> https is populated into the url redirects object from Tredlyfile.
- `tredlyhost.getContainersWithArray()` now returns a unique set() instead of a list
- JSON schema updated so that `urlCert` is set to None when not present in the Tredlyfile. This applies redirects also.
- A redirect URL must have a certificate set if it uses https. Likewise, there must not be a certificate set when using http.

#### Fixed
- Fixed issue with "any" rules not being applied on containers with no `ip4Whitelist` and no `containerGroup`
- Fixed bug in `fileFolderMapping` where part of the path would be truncated when copying data from partition

### CORE
#### Added
- Added command `tredly api password` to set api password
- Implemented `tredly status` command. Shows information for the following: `api`, `commandcenter`, `dns`, `layer7proxy`

#### Changed
- Updated `tredly init` to fetch sources from HTTPS instead of HTTP

## [1.0.0-beta - 2016-06-06]
#### Added
- Start & stop for containers, a lot of code has been refactored to facilitate this

#### Changed
- Moved API installation location within Tredly installer

#### Fixed

- Bugfixes for ipfw in container
- Bugfix for reloading DNS on create

## 1.0.0-beta - 2016-06-02
#### Added
- Initial release of Tredly rewrite
- Single codebase (i.e. removal of seperate tredly-host and tredly-build repositories)
- Framework now written in Python 3 (many supporting libraries are still in written in BASH)
